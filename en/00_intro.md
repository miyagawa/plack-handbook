## Introduction

This little handbook is based on the content of the [Plack Advent Calendar](http://advent.plackperl.org/) website. The calendar had 24 useful short posts explaining the concept of PSGI and how to adapt existing web applications to Plack.

The calendar was so successful it's been considered a canonical reference for many beginners trying to learn Plack and for web framework authors trying to adapt their code to work with PSGI.

But the content was written 3 years ago and some of it is a little dated. In this book I tried to get it correct and up-to-date, and it will continue to be updated as we find errata and get feedback from the reader community.

Raw source code of the book, in Markdown format, is available on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/miyagawa/plack-handbook) under the Creative Commons license. See the LICENSE file for details.
